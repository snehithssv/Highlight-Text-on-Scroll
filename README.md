# Highlight-Text-on-Scroll
To highlight text on vertical scroll for all browsers.

For chromium broswers, we can use just css for adding on scroll text highlight text but for non-chomium mainly safari and firefox these animation-timeline and animation-range are not supported. So for this repo solves using js functionality. 

For just css or in future if browsers support the -css variables(animation timeline or range) refer to this clip from Kevin Powell
